							<h2>Dashboard</h2>
							<p>
								The home page of the web app is a comprehensive portfolio dashboard that 
                                displays essential details about my investments. It organizes my holdings 
                                by providing key metrics such as stock prices, market value, profit/loss, and 
                                percent allocation within my portfolio. I can easily add personalized 
                                notes for each stock, document research insights, or track investment 
                                strategies. Additionally, the dashboard allows me to set and update custom 
                                price targets, helping me make informed decisions with all relevant data at 
                                my fingertips.

							<h2>Sector Breakdown</h2>
                            <p>
								The sector breakdown page offers an in-depth analysis of my portfolio 
                                diversification. At its core is a visually engaging bar chart powered 
                                by Plotly, which highlights the allocation of my portfolio across 
                                various sectors. Each sector is color-coded for clarity, allowing me 
                                to quickly assess the strengths and weaknesses of my current 
                                diversification strategy. This page provides an intuitive view of my 
                                overall investment strategy and highlights areas that may need adjustment.

                            <h2>Sector Performance Integration</h2>
                            <p>
								A unique feature of the sector breakdown page is its integration of past 
                                performance data with my current allocations. Using an embedded chart 
                                from 
                                <a href="https://novelinvestor.com/sector-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                                    Novel Investor</a>, the app displays historical performance for each 
                                sector over the past several years. This historical chart is shown 
                                alongside my personalized sector allocation, enabling me to easily 
                                compare trends and performance against my current investments. This 
                                dual perspective helps me better understand the impact of market trends 
                                on my portfolio and refine my strategies accordingly.

							<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
                            <p>
								The web app is built with a robust tech stack that combines Python, Flask, 
                                and SQLite for backend operations. It fetches real-time portfolio data 
                                using the Schwab Developer API and integrates external APIs like Yahoo 
                                Finance for live stock data and analytics. The frontend leverages HTML, 
                                CSS, JavaScript, and Plotly for interactive visualizations and a dynamic 
                                user experience. By blending full-stack development with data-driven insights, 
                                the app delivers a powerful, intuitive platform for portfolio management.
