							<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									In 2017, I entered the world of stock trading with my first trade: one
									share of Bank of America at $25.47. Since then, I've been developing
									trading strategies that I actively use on a weekly basis. As I started
									my professional career in 2019, I realized the need to optimize my
									time spent on market research for short-term trades. To address this,
									I created a Python program using an API that allowed me to automate
									tasks and regain time lost due to my full-time job.
								</p>

							<h2>Project Growth and Automation</h2>
								<p>
									Over the past few years, I've expanded my skill set by diving into
									frameworks, databases, and object-oriented programming in Python.
									Notably, I've enhanced my project by leveraging cloud computing and
									automation techniques. For instance, I created a cron job on Netlify
									to execute this program daily, ensuring I receive email	updates
									each day the market is open.
								</p>

								<p>
									In addition to my ongoing development journey, I'm currently engaged
									in a smaller-scale Python-based web app. This project revolves around
									automating holiday gift exchanges for groups, showcasing my proficiency
									in object-oriented programming. With the knowledge and experience
									gained from my previous project, I am eager to apply improved
									programming practices that align with my current expertise to elevate
									the functionality and efficiency of this application.
								</p>

							<h2>Modules</h2>

								<h3>SMAs</h3>
									<p>
										Technical analysis has proven to be highly rewarding for me. By
										utilizing simple moving averages (SMAs), I can efficiently identify
										breakouts and trends across various stocks. Instead of spending
										countless hours navigating charts on ThinkorSwim, I have streamlined
										the process by automating it using an API provided by a broker.
										This module generates an Excel sheet and a set of charts highlighting
										tickers experiencing significant breakouts or trends. These valuable
										insights are promptly emailed to me, allowing me to conduct further
										research from an optimal starting point.
									</p>
								<h3>CSPs</h3>
									<p>
										In options trading, I employ multiple strategies, with one of my most
										frequently used being selling cash-secured puts (CSPs). It is crucial
										to note that selling options carries inherent risks and should always
										be approached with thorough research. To streamline this process, I
										have developed a significant module called CSP.py within the program.
										This module effectively filters out high-risk option contracts such
										as those with low volume or low chances of profit. By providing a
										starting point for in-depth research, it empowers me to make informed
										decisions, conveniently accessible in the CSP tab of the Excel sheet.
									</p>
								<h3>Positions</h3>
									<p>
										Lastly, the Positions module generates a dedicated spreadsheet tab
										that lists my current stock equity, option equity, and other
										pertinent information extracted from my broker account for me to
										review.
