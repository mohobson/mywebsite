							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>
								Last year, my friends and I gathered to draw names for a Secret Santa
								gift exchange. However, we faced a challenge - three couples
								among the six of us made the traditional drawing process a frustrating
								endeavor. Restarting multiple times and compromising the secretive
								nature of the game wasn't ideal.
							</p>

							<p>
								To tackle this problem and enhance our Secret Santa experience, I wrote
								a Python script. The script allowed us to input our names and emails,
								along with listing the names of significant	others within the group.
								Its algorithm then matched players who weren't significant others,
								seamlessly notifying each member of their secret match through email.
							</p>

							<p>
								I've been working on enhancing this project using object-oriented
								programming principles. By leveraging the versatile Flask framework
								and incorporating an SQLite database, I'm transitioning the script
								into a more robust and scalable application. To ensure reliable email
								delivery, I'm integrating the SendGrid email service.
							</p>

							<p>
								This project has been a valuable learning experience for me, enabling
								me to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming and
								refine my knowledge of web development workflows. By continuously
								updating and expanding its capabilities, I aim to incorporate best
								practices and industry-standard techniques into my work.
							</p>

							<p>
								The initial version of this project is available under my
								<a href="https://github.com/mohobson/SecretSanta">SecretSanta repository</a>
								on Github. This version utilizes an Excel spreadsheet as the input.
								The ReadMe will guide you through how to use it. 
							</p>
							
							<p>
								The more current but incomplete web app version of this project is available
								under my 
								<a href="https://github.com/mohobson/gift-exchange">gift-exchange repository</a>
								on Github. The web app is operable locally, but I am currently
								working on finalizing the SQLite database. Lastly, I need to set up
								Flask Blueprints so users can log in for a personalized experience.
