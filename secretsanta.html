							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>
								Last year, my friends and I gathered to draw names for a Secret Santa
								gift exchange. However, we faced a challenge - three dating couples
								amongst the six of us made the traditional drawing process a frustrating
								endeavor. Matching with a significant other seemed less exciting to us,
								but redrawing names multiple times and compromising the secretive
								nature of the game wasn't ideal either.
							</p>

							<p>
								To tackle this problem and enhance our Secret Santa experience, I wrote
								a Python script. The script allowed us to input our names and emails,
								along with pairings of names of significant	others within the group.
								The script then matched players who weren't significant others and
								seamlessly notifyied each member of their secret match through email.
							</p>
							
							<p style="color: #FFFFFF">
								The project evolved into a full-scale web application. I built the website
								around the Python algorithm using Flask framework and now the tool is free
								and easy for anyone to use. 
							</p>

							<p>
								From what started as a Python script that used an Excel sheet as a 
								method for inputs, I leveraged the versatile Flask framework and 
								incorporated an SQLite database that resulted in a robust and scalable
								web application deployed on Render.
							</p>

							<p>
								This project has been a valuable learning experience for me, enabling
								me to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming and
								refine my knowledge of web development workflows. By continuously
								updating and expanding its capabilities, I aim to incorporate best
								practices and industry-standard techniques into my work. Although 
								frontend development wasn't my primary focus on this project, I intend
								to continue sharpening my knowledge of CSS and JavaScript while
								making the site look more appealing.
