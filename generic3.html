							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>On monthxx dayxx, I made my first trade on the stock market (1 share of Bank of America at $25). Since then, I developed trading strategies that I use on a weekly basis. As I entered the workforce in 2019, I found myself stretching to perform all of the market research I wanted to conduct for short-term trades. So, I began developing this program to buy back the time I lost from working full-time. This is my favorite personal project because it has enabled me to continue to do two things I love: trading and programming. The program is under continuous development and has been over the last couple years as new ideas and needs pop up.</p>
							<h2>SMAs</h2>
							<p>Simple technical analysis has been rewarding for me. Using simple moving averages (SMAs), I can identify breakouts and trends for different stocks. I could spend hours opening up charts in ThinkorSwim, wondering where to start, but that is time consuming. Using criteria, I have automated this process in a personalized way using Robinhood's API. With the click of a button, this program will create an Excel sheet and a series of charts with tickers experiencing breakouts or trends. This information is then emailed to me so I can conduct further research at a much better starting point.</p>
							<h2>CSPs</h2>
							<p>I also have various strategies for options trading. My most common option trading strategy is selling cash secured puts (CSPs). Selling options is a risky strategy, and should never be done without extensive research (TRUST ME!!). A major module within this program is called CSP.py. It is capable of filtering out the riskier option contracts (low volume, low chance of profit, etc.), providing me with a starting point for further research in the CSP tab of the Excel sheet.</p>
							<h2>Positions</h2>
							<p>Finally, this program provides a tab that displays my current stock equity, option equity, and some additional information from my account on Robinhood.</p>
